        <p class="mb-4">
          Fruiting In a Mood (FIM) was founded by Clydel Smith in 1972 with a passion for growing high-quality fruits. 
          Starting with just a few acres of land and a small roadside stand, FIM quickly gained a reputation for its delicious 
          apples, pears, and peaches.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4"> 
          Over the years, FIM expanded its farm and began experimenting with new varieties of fruits. They also started participating 
          in farmers' markets and selling their fruits to local grocery stores. In the 1990s, Clydel's son, Michael, took over the farm 
          and continued to expand and modernize it. He implemented sustainable farming practices and introduced new fruits, such as berries 
          and cherries, to the farm.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          In 2010, Fruiting In a Mood (FIM) upgraded its operations to include online grocery sales, which quickly became popular among customers. 
          They offered a wide range of fresh fruits, including hard-to-find varieties, and delivered directly to customers' doorsteps.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Today, Fruiting In a Mood has over 100 acres of land and produces a wide variety of fruits. They have a farm store that sells their fruits
          and other local products, as well as a popular "pick-your-own" program that allows visitors to experience the farm firsthand. Despite its growth,
          Fruiting In a Mood (FIM) remains a family-owned and operated business, committed to providing high-quality, sustainable fruits to its customers.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Fruiting In a Mood (FIM) is a family-owned fruit farm that has been producing high-quality fruits for over 50 years. Our founder, Clydel Smith, started FIM 
          with just a few acres of land and a passion for growing the best fruits possible. Over the years, we've expanded our farm and experimented with new varieties 
          of fruits, always striving to improve the quality of our products.
        </p>

        <p>
          At FIM, we're committed to using sustainable farming practices to provide our customers with the freshest and healthiest fruits possible. We believe that farming 
          should be done with respect for the land and the surrounding ecosystem, which is why we use techniques such as crop rotation, natural pest control, and minimal use 
          of chemicals. Our wide variety of fruits, including apples, pears, peaches, berries, and cherries, are available through our farm store, online ordering, and pick-your-own 
          programs. We're passionate about providing the best fruits around and sharing our love of fresh, delicious produce with our customers.
